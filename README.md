# MIT IEEE Undergraduate Research Technology Conference 2023
I attended MIT [URTC](https://urtc.mit.edu/) during 12th grade and presented my poster regarding my research titled:  
**An Alternative Method to Experimentally Determine Drag Coefficient**

Here is the [Poster Presentation Session Schedule](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RpYd-rULck2FcGRaE4YQzWQrBvJxLirQ/view).

# Abstract

Determining the drag coefficient of a design is crucial for engineers working with vehicles or objects that traverse through fluids. Traditionally, drag coefficients are determined through wind tunnel testing or computational fluid dynamic simulations, both of which are expensive and mostly accessible to professional labs or research centers. In this study, we explore an alternative method using equipment accessible to students to determine the drag coefficient.

# Experimental Results

Each blue dot represents a data point. The red dotted line is the curve fit line with Cd listed above. Oscillations are clearly present after around 2 seconds. The curve fit of all 13 trials resulted in a Cd of 0.5Â±0.03. The method explored in the study can also be used to determine drag coefficients of other shapes, such as model rockets, outside of the lab. The test results can be useful as well for a discussion on potential effects of other related factors such as air turbulence and Reynolds number.


# Primary Instrument

Here are a few pictures of the 3D printed spheres that were dropped from the drone. In the two right most pictures there are two spheres, the smaller one is the first prototype design. It's parachute was attached to the release module and was deployed by a string connecting to the sphere. Due to string length limitations, only around 1 second of free fall data could be collected. My second sphere design included a onboard release servo and had the parachute stowed within it. This allowed for much more data to be collected and ultimately proved crucial for further data analysis.

# Data Collection

The sphere was lifted by drone to 100m AGL. A release pin was then retracted dropping the sphere. The upper cover of the sphere was automatically ejected after 3.68s (approximately 50m AGL). The parachute stowed between the upper and lower covers was deployed at the same time. Accelerometer data were recorded from release to manual stop.

## Video Clips

Here are a few videos showcasing the data collection process for the first prototype sphere mentioned above. The parachute is connected to the sphere and released by a 5m string. (Thank you to my mom for catching this time xD)

# Preliminary Experiment to Determine Effects of Propeller Downwash

As my research focuses on objects' interactions with air, it is important that external disturbances are kept at minimal. Drones stay aloft by pushing air downwards and its effect must be properly accounted for.

After around 100 half rotations of the spinners, the standard deviations in pressure data drop to around ambient levels. This distance was doubled on later data colletion trials.

## Device Design

Inspired by NASA's Sky Crane design, I built a small cart that is able to move up and down by releasing or retracting a set of strings stowed on two spinners on either sides of the compartment. By attaching barometric pressure sensors to the cart, I can measure the amount of noise in the data at different distances below the drone and determine where the effect of propellor downwash is negligible.
